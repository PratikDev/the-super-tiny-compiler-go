# the super tiny compiler - Go

This project is a Golang port of [the-super-tiny-compiler](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/the-super-tiny-compiler) project which is mainly written in JavaScript. I got the idea from [this](https://github.com/hazbo/the-super-tiny-compiler) project, which is also a Go port of the original one and is listed in [Build Your Own X](https://build-your-own-x.vercel.app/#build-your-own-programming-language)

## Did I just copy pasted?
