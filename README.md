# the super tiny compiler - Go

This project is a Golang port of [the-super-tiny-compiler](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/the-super-tiny-compiler) project which is mainly written in JavaScript. I got the idea from [this](https://github.com/hazbo/the-super-tiny-compiler) project, which is also a Go port of the original one and is listed in [Build Your Own X](https://build-your-own-x.vercel.app/#build-your-own-programming-language)

First, I thought to just follow along the Go port by [Hazbo](https://github.com/hazbo), but then I realized, I already know good enough Golang to do it myself. So I started from scratch and did it my way.

## Did I just copy pasted?

No

## Questions I have so far

- What's the use case of the `traverse` function?
- Why do we need a transformed AST? Why can't we just use the original one?
